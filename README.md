# XQuery
Simple XQuery expressions to extract useful information from some real XML data.

# XML Data
The datafiles are from the British National Corpus, a collection of English language data widely used by linguists and computational linguists, together with a schema. There is a full explanation of the schema1, but the important parts here are:

  --> "<s>" represents a sentence, containing possibly many children <w> representing words in linear order;
  --> "<w>" YYY "</w>" represents word YYY.
